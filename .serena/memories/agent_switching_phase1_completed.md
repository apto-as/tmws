# Agent Switching Phase 1 Implementation - COMPLETED

## Implemented Components

### 1. AgentContextManager Class (tmws/agent_context_manager.py)
- Pre-configured Trinitas agents (athena, artemis, hestia, eris, hera, muses)
- Agent switching with history tracking
- Support for both short names and full IDs
- Session management and switch counting

### 2. MCP Tools Added (tmws/mcp_server.py)
- **switch_agent**: Dynamic agent switching with auto-registration
- **get_current_agent**: Returns current context with capabilities and history
- **list_trinitas_agents**: Shows all available Trinitas agents
- **execute_as_agent**: Temporary agent context for single operations

### 3. Integration
- AgentContextManager integrated into MCP server initialization
- Automatic synchronization between environment variables and agent manager
- Support for both environment-based and runtime switching

## Key Features
- Hybrid approach: Environment variables + MCP tools
- Automatic agent registration on switch
- Context preservation and restoration for execute_as_agent
- Full compatibility with existing TMWS infrastructure

## Testing Status
- AgentContextManager unit test: ✓ Passed
- Git commit and push: ✓ Successful
- uvx installation: ✓ Works (requires database setup for full functionality)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Add memory operations with as_agent parameter
- Implement permission matrix for agent switching
- Add audit logging for agent switches
- Performance optimization for concurrent agent access
