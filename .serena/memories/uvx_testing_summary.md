# UVX Testing Summary

## Successfully Completed
1. Removed all version numbers from filenames (mcp_server_v2.py, memory_v2.py, etc.)
2. Fixed .gitignore to not exclude code models directory
3. Added missing model files to git tracking
4. Fixed import paths for package installation
5. Added PyJWT dependency
6. Created synchronous entry point for package scripts
7. Fixed settings attribute access

## Current Status
The package installs via uvx but encounters runtime errors due to:
- Database connection requirements (needs PostgreSQL)
- Missing environment configuration
- Service initialization dependencies

## Test Command
```bash
export TMWS_AGENT_ID="test-agent"
export TMWS_ALLOW_DEFAULT_AGENT="true"
uvx --from git+https://github.com/apto-as/tmws.git tmws
```

## Known Issues
- Deprecation warnings from Pydantic V1 validators
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 deprecation warnings
- Missing bleach library warnings
- Database initialization requires PostgreSQL connection

## Next Steps
Would need to:
1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Configure database connection string
3. Run database migrations
4. Properly initialize MCP server with FastMCP

The basic package structure and installation via uvx is working correctly.
